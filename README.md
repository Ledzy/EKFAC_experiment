## Project Description
The code is developed based on the implementation of https://github.com/Thrandis/EKFAC-pytorch, which implements the KFAC and EKFAC algorithms proposed by the following two paper:

#### K-FAC:
- James Martens, Roger Grosse, _[Optimizing Neural Networks with Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671)_, ICML 2015
#### EKFAC:
 - Thomas George, CÃ©sar Laurent, Xavier Bouthillier, Nicolas Ballas, Pascal Vincent, _[Fast Approximate Natural Gradient Descent in a Kronecker-factored Eigenbasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03884)_, NIPS 2018

 It aims to repeat the experiment results in the paper, and examine the behavior of the KFAC and EKFAC algorithms.
